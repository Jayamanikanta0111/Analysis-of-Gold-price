## 📌 About the Project

The goal of this project is to explore and visualize the trends in gold prices using real-time data. The analysis includes data preprocessing, trend visualization, statistical summaries, and correlation with other variables (if provided). The findings can be used by investors, economists, and researchers to better understand gold as a financial asset.

### ✅ Key Features

- Real-world historical gold price data used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time series visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Analysis of trends, averages, and distributions
- Monthly and yearly price analysis
- Correlation matrix (if multiple economic indicators are available)
- Dynamic plots for interactive exploration

## 📊 Dataset Description

Features commonly used (depending on dataset used):
- `Date` – Timestamp of the recorded gold price
- `Price` – Price of gold per ounce (in USD or INR)
- Additional economic indicators (optional) like:
  - Crude Oil Price
  - US Dollar Index
  - Inflation Rate
  - Interest Rates
